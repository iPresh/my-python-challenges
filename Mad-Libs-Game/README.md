### Mad Libs: Instructions
Mad Libs is a phrase template word game. One player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, then reads the story aloud.

If you've never seen mad libs before, it's an interactive story generator. You can see and online example here.

In this project, you are going to write a Mad Libs game. The program should prompt the user for some words, and then fill in the blanks in the story with those words.

To write the program:

- Write a story of your own and keep it as strings in the program.
- Prompt the user for different words. For example: "Enter a funny word" and "Enter your last name"
- Store all the responses the user entered
- Complete the story by filling the blanks (originally left empty for user input)
- Print out the full story

Be creative, and have fun!

##### Tips and Hints  
You can use lots of print statements, instead of one big one  
Be mindful of your syntax! It's easy to miss a character.  
Be careful about the spaces in your strings. Python won't add extra space, so you need to add it in your code.
