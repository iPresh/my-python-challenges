### Instructions

Write a program that tells users if they have enough money to buy their desired number of books.

Each book costs $20. The program should ask the user to enter how many books they want to buy, and how much money they have.

The program will then let the user know if they have enough money to buy the books. Or, if they don't have enough, it will let them know how much more is needed.

If they have enough, print:
```
You have enough money, go for it!
```

If they need $12 more to buy the books, print:

    You need $12 more to buy that number of books

If they need more or less than 12, print however much they need.
