### Currency Conversion: Instructions  

In this exercise, you'll help the user convert currency from US Dollars to Naira.  

Write a program that prompts the user for a USD value, and outputs the value, converted to NGN.   

Use input to get the USD value from the user.  

Convert the USD value to NGN by multiplying it by the exchange rate.  

Print out the NGN value (formatted with 2 decimal points).  

The starter code specifies the exchange rate to use:  

NAIRA_PER_DOLLAR = 410.59 # exchange rate as of Nov 10 2021
