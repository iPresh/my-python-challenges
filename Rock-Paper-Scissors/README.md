### Instructions

In this assignment, you'll recreate the classic game of rock, paper, scissors.

If you’ve never played before, or need a refresher: two players each choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. They show their choice at the same time. Depending on their choice, there’s a win, lose, or draw.

- Rock smashes Scissors
- Scissors cut Paper
- Paper covers Rock  

If the two choices are the same, it’s a draw  

Rock, Paper, and Scissors are the only choices allowed.
