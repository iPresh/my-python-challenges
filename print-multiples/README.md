### Instructions

Write a program that asks the user for a number, then prints a result based on the following rules

Follow these rules:

If the number is a multiple of three, print X is a multiple of 3
If the number is a multiple of 5, print X is a multiple of 5
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program should print X is a multiple of both 3 and 5
Otherwise, just print the number.
For the 'X' in the rules above, print the number, not the letter 'X.' So, if the number the user enters is 42, your program should print   
```
42 is a multiple of 3.
